features:
- title: Built for the architecturally inclined
  details: Modular-monoliths? Decoupled components? SOLID principles? Slim controllers? If those terms appeal to you, you are at the right place!
- title: Intuitive Design
  details: Given a penchant for OOP, class names are preferred over aliases in all cases (labelling, payloads/DTOs, routing), both for instant recognition of its purpose and location, but for lazy-loading and auto-wiring them. In addition, there are includes, no folder scanning, no questionable instantiation (during booting or whenever) is done without your consent
- title: Infinite flexibility
  details: Every step of the core experience is both replaceable and configurable in order to maximize your comfort. No conventional assumptions are made regarding project's requirements. No hard-coded folder names. Don't like the ORM? Swap it out!

# Introduction

Suphple is a php framework that by default, ships with an MVVM paradigm for creating stateful web applications. It builds upon some of the [industry's most trusted](/docs/v1/database) components, but can equally get out of the way for you to insert libraries that make you feel more at home. Its recommended stack is STT (Suphple-Transphporm-Turbo)


While building your projects with it, expect to often trigger custom [events](/docs/v1/events), extend your classes -- which could be anything from [routes](/docs/v1/routing) to [controllers](/docs/v1/controllers) or services; in short, you'll be performing practices for frequently changing, dynamic, and testable web applications.

It equally expects such programs to be patronized by large traffic, and [retain the performance](/docs/v1/flows) of a typical hello world introductory tutorial. Going forward, integration with asynchronous frameworks is [slated](/docs/v1/roadmap) to commence when it garners sufficient traction, both in order to curb the concurrency concern and deliver responses at unbeatable speeds

### Sustainability

Being the framework of choice to power a number of long term projects currently in the works, there is no doubt it'll be the subject of constant updates improving it both in the near and distant future

### Closing remarks
If the features described above are yet to resonate with your use cases and you'd like to have them looked into, do not hesitate to [contact the author](mailto:vainglories@gmail.com) to discuss them. 

However, if you are curious to learn more concerning the details of this overview, I hope you enjoy the ride aboard this ship!üö§

The love you have for what you build naturally reflects in the artsy attention paid to it. What if every thing could be built that way without the costly expense of tedium?
