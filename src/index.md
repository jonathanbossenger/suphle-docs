Domain Driven Design? Modular-monoliths, decoupled components, SOLID principles, slim controllers, and service oriented architectures. If those terms appeal to you, you are at the right place!

#introduction
Suphple (derived from the English word, "supple") is a php framework that by default, ships with an mvvm paradigm 
for creating stateful web applications. It builds upon some of the industry's most trusted components, but can equally get out of the way for you to insert libraries that make you feel more at home. Its recommended stack is STT (Suphple-Transphporm-Turbo)


While building your projects with it, expect to often trigger custom 
events, extend your classes -- which could be anything from routes to 
controllers or services; in short, you'll be performing practices for 
frequently changing, dynamic, and testable web applications.

It equally expects such programs to be patronized by large traffic, and retain the performance of a typical hello world introductory tutorial. Going forward, integration with asynchronous frameworks is slated [link to roadmap] to commence any time in the near future, both in order to curb the concurrency concern and deliver responses at unbeatable speeds

#how does it compare against others?
Present performance benchmarks

#sustainability
Given the fact that Suphple is the framework of choice to power a number of 
long term projects currently in the works, there is no doubt that it'll be 
the subject of constant updates improving it both in the near and distant 
future

#Closing remarks
If you are yet to relate with any of these use cases and would like to have 
it looked into, do not hesitate to contact me to discuss what your 
requirements look like. But if you are curious to learn more concerning the 
details of this overview, well, welcome aboard!

I hope you enjoy the rideüö§

The love you have for what you build naturally reflects in the artsy 
attention paid to it. What if everything could be built that way without 
the costly expense of tedium?
