# Containers

Container pages are not the kind typically visited while perusing documentation. However, understanding what can be achieved with Suphple's container promises to pay huge dividends in the long run. But first of all, what is a container, and what does it "contain", anyway?

## Introduction
At the most basic level, they are object caches â€” you store object instances in them so you don't instantiate multiple versions of the same class and have them running all over the place. As applications grow more complex, we look onto them to fulfill needs beyond just object caching.

Containers are the missing feature of every back end language. They are associated with making concretes out of interfaces but take care of other details such as hydrating and wiring arguments. One characteristic of a 
good back end framework is that its container is both versatile and powerful enough for the developer to never pull objects out of it directly.

For the dynamism and OOP flexibility Suphple programs are expected to have, developers should not shy away from actively interacting with the container. The framework itself heavily relies on it to achieve the modular architecture.

## Auto-wiring and dependency injection

In practice, this refers to the process of type-hinting class constructors or specific methods of certain interfaces in order to reference predefined entities. These entities could be anything from interfaces to base types or primitives. The important takeaway is that developer doesn't get to use the `new` keyword or instantiate the constructor's arguments prior to their introduction into the required class.

Auto-wiring is not some abstract concept only used to intercept request objects in action methods. It should be part and parcel of your codebase in order for those dependencies to be easily replaceable both during mocking and refactoring.

- `getClass`

Suphple internally uses this method to hydrate entity instances. Those entities will usually rely on types that are either [provided](/docs/v1/service-provision) before the entity requests for them, or are instantiated at runtime. If you refer to the diagram in the [Basics](/docs/v1/basics/#anatomy-of-a-suphple-module), the numbered segments excluding 1, 2, and 7 all have auto-wiring enabled on their constructors. This implies you would hardly ever have the need to use this method directly. However, understanding how it works may prove beneficial in the way your object signatures are defined.

Describe the fresh instance steps

Pulling classes doesn't compare against types of provided entities. It simply won't work given the way objects are being stored for fast retrieval i.e. direct lookup, which is what type-hinting uses. In cases where this behavior is desirable, you will be better served by using the `sub` parameter

## Contextual Binding
If you are transitioning from front-end development, think of this as the back-end's version of state management. As earlier discussed, the Container is a repository of objects floating around in memory. Each of those objects can exist in states differing from what they were when instantiated. Contextual binding enables us assign objects in these desired states to diverse callers. This means that when hydrating those callers, or when they explicitly request these objects, predefined instances will be handed over to them. This *pre-definition* is known as object/service **provisioning**. There are a few ways to provision objects, either depending on how you intend the caller receives the object, or [when object should be hydrated](/docs/v1/service-providers).

Callers can either consume dependencies from their constructors or by directly invoking [`getClass`](#auto-wiring-and-dependency-injection)

// example
In both scenarios, the desired outcome can be different. As earlier mentioned, Suphple internally makes heavy use of calls to `getClass`, so you don't have to unless you are a [plugin developer](/docs/v1/plugins). Think of it as an avenue to replace the regular hydration of those classes.

- `whenType(string ConsumerClass)`

This is the genesis of all contextual binding. The type being provided is supplied, and a fluent interface is returned for definition of the dependencies.

Bear in mind that while hydrating arguments for a provisioned type, if those any of the arguments were equally provisioned, their provided context will take precedence over that of the calling type

/// Example

- `whenTypeAny()`

Equally functions as `whenType`, however, it enables this definition to apply to every other class that wasn't provided

- `needs(array types)`

In order to directly influence `getClass` return value on a per-caller basis, the desired concrete must be provided to it through this method
///
Example

Notice it works with `whenType`. Calls to any of the `needs` methods without first defining what type is being provided will result in an exception.

Container->spaceNeedsFrom: Doesn't make services implementing interfaces 
strictly required. Useful while maybe refactoring from one service 
implementation to another, on a scale spanning multiple controllers

## Circular dependencies
These are usually a code smell. Which is why most containers crumble when these are thrown at them. Logical flow ought to be composed in a hierarchical manner that expresses the lower level elements as entirely oblivious of their higher level counterparts. Service return values should be collated at a central point such as the controller and sent to evaluating service. Such situations are usually an indication that some part of those services should exist on their own. This enriches the application with a decoupled dependency chain, and by extension, testability.

That said, "tell, don't ask" principle may appeal to some, and services can wind up in the constructor of their own dependencies. For instance, it may be undesirable to retrieve values from service x and plug into y (show example of chatty controller). In such cases, Suphple's container handles it using an otherwise, primitive implementation of class templates/generics/decorators

```php

class A {

    function __construct(B $foo) {
        dump($foo);
        // $this->foo = $foo;
    }
}
```

```php

class B {

    function __construct(A $foo) {
        dump($foo);
        // $this->foo = $foo;
    }
}
```
