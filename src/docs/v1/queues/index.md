##QUEUES
Events are a direct precursor to queues. Think of them as deferred events. 
If events are a way of extracting unrelated code from visual flow and 
opening up code for injecting and extending, queues are a way of delegating 
the event bootstrap and invocation process
While it may be tempting to defer events and functionality, beware of 
business requirements making it unrealistic to dispense value without 
awaiting completion of an orderly sequence of activities
