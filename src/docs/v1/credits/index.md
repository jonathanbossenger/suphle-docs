Suphple was created by Nmeri Alphonsus, a software architect whose stock in trade has been to break features and plumb user stories everywhere the opportunity to do so has presented itself, for a better part of the last decade. In the interim, his attention has inclined towards the most efficient techniques for building back ends that are durable enough to never age -- object structures and their arrangement; confirming objects live up to the expectations of both their author and the real-world concepts they represent.

Over the long term, he is poised to build upon the foundations of the present day web landscape, and leave the practice in a better state than it was met.

Suphple is one of his efforts to redeem developers from the horrors and abyss of technical debt into the enjoyable path of productive engineering. This implies assembling the most fitting tools in existence, or creating those that will best empower them to deliver the topmost quality when the stakes are at their highest.

He is on the constant lookout for challenges that broaden the scope of his experience across the range of development encompassing advanced concepts not frequently explored. He aims to further encounter practices and scenarios that can be improved even to the slightest degree.

He is equally drawn to artsy demonstration of software techniques. As such, he will eagerly lend attentive ears should such opportunity rear its head in form of a conversation, article, or opening preferably involving Suphple.

Other interests of his that can provoke delightful discourse include Game of Thrones, Lionel Messi, the human condition, and dank memes. If you mean to reach out regarding any of the above, he will be waiting over at [the mailbox](mailto:vainglories17@gmail.com) with arms wide open. <!-- Or, if you're one of the cool kids, you can ping him on Twitter instead. -->

Special gratitude to Laravel's maintainers, who have been examplary in  producing some of the most extensible components in the game, without which the foundation to lay Suphle upon would've been much more steep--namely, Eloquent and TestResponse

Happy coding!
