Suphple was created by Nmeri Alphonsus, a software architect whose stock in trade has been to break features and plumb user stories at [a fast paced startup](http://kaiglo.com). He is poised to build upon the foundations of the present day web landscape, and leave the practice in a better state than it was met.

Suphple is one of his efforts to redeem developers from the horrors and adverse effects of technical debt, into the enjoyable path of productive engineering. This documentation can be considered the author's best way of conveying his intents and philosophies.

If you want to reach out to crack open a feverish discourse concerning Game of Thrones, Lionel Messi, dank memes, some riveting software engineering concept or anything at all concerning Suphple, he will anxiously be waiting over at [the mailbox](mailto:vainglories@gmail.com). <!-- Or, if you're one of the cool kids, you can ping him on Twitter instead -->.

Happy coding!
