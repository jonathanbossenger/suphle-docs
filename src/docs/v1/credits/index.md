##CREDITS
Suphple was created by Nmeri Alphonsus, a software architect who has spent 
the last few years breaking and plumbing user stories at a fast paced 
startup. He is poised to build upon the foundations left behind by the 
present day web landscape, and leave the practice in a better state than he 
met it

Suphple is one of his efforts to transform potential technical debt into a 
palpable mass of lasting solutions. This documentation makes reference to 
the many review cycles (earlier 
drafts) required to determine how best to convey the author's intents and 
philosophies

If you want to reach out to crack open a feverish discourse concerning game 
of thrones, Lionel Messi, dank memes, some riveting software engineering 
concept or anything at all concerning Suphple, he will anxiously be waiting 
over at the mailbox. Or, if you're one of the cool kids, you can ping him 
on Twitter instead. Happy coding!
