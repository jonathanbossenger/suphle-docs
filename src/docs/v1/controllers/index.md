# Controllers

## Introduction
The Controller is where the behaviour behind each endpoint is decided.

How do we retrieve input from the outside world?

## Validation
Now we have seen how to intercept values from our users, an important caveat to bear in my mind is how to shield our beloved application from receiving unexpected values
/// connect validator to controller

While it may seem daunting to create validators for each non-GET path, recall that Applications crumble when its user is allowed to do unexpected things. It always pays off when their every move is anticipated in the sandbox of a validator

highlight the fact that any method other than GET will result in an error in the absence of a validator for that request

## Model hydration

```php
function jj (ControllerModel $newData) { // conceals News::where(id, id) stored on property x

        $this->newsRepository->updateJj($newData, $request); // cleaner. gets are lazier and under developer's control. avoids duplicating builders
}
```

`newData` has to match the incoming placeholder for this to work (Is this still valid?)

## Permitted services
Constructor injection

## Config
Validating dependencies at runtime may raise some eyebrows, especially when there are less on-demand solutions such as static analysis after each code update. It is assumed that the barrier for syntax memorization is so low, any beginner can get in â€” junior developers who should not be trusted to know what they're doing. In exchange, the cost of validation is a few micro seconds in performance. If it's either not a price you are willing to pay, perhaps out of trust in your abilities and that of your colleagues, the controller configuration setting method "validates" should return false

# Services

Explain what ReboundsEvents, CommandService do (assumes the underlying method is laden with db calls to numerous tables)

One of the incentives for services to inherit from a semantic type is that one can comfortably launch a list of db-based operations and only begin their IO counterparts when the DB ops succeed. If the operations fail and are being rolled back, the caller catches the error and either recurses until success is achieved, or doesn't proceed to send out the IO calls
