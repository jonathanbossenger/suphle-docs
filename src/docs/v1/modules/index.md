# Modules

## Preamble: The modular philosophy
One of the great dividends of building opinionated structures is that it solves the architectural problem for its eventual user. With that out of the way, they are left to think in services -- isolated, exportable micro-units of logic. Think of it as a [design system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_system) for back-ends. Every mature design system has a user-contributed gallery of components conforming to its principles. *That* is one of the eventual dreams with Suphple; that projects can be commenced and executed with the aid of extended, freely available domain-specific business-oriented micro-dependencies, with nearly identical coding styles

## When to create a new module
While there are an infinite number of factors deciding when part of an application should gain autonomy, a few are logical. But there's no standard cast in stone â€” only a few general rules of thumb. One obvious indicator is them having the same route prefix. As for unrelated concepts, It is usually safer for them to start out as separate modules dependent on each other, and only be merged into one when the interactions between them becomes more than trivial. If module A's controller is dominated by calls to different services borrowed from a module it depends on, it could mean they belong together

configuration passed into Modules should be assigned to instance level 
properties. Inside the relevant service provider/config, the module will be type 
hinted, and the value lifted

Each module should have its own vendor folder i.e. None at the root
