## Documentation creed/tenets

1. No initial degree in technical writing is required. Just keep the language simple.

1. Descriptions shouldn't feel informal, confrontation or conversational. Save those for personal blog posts.

1. Where applicable but not in excess, demonstrate the subject behavior being described using code samples. Praxis conveys concepts faster where theoretical clarity is elusive.

## Acceptable changes

1. Typographic and grammatical corrections.
1. Additional clarification over ambiguous behavior behind a Suphle component.
1. Bringing to light the edge-case behavior of a component not covered already.
1. Describing a new feature or component you've implemented on Suphle itself.

## Before modifying this documentation

1. If a section of the documentation is perceived to diverge from the behavior it seeks to describe, consider demonstrating this on a Github issue using a test that attempts to exhibit alleged malfunction.

1. If your alteration or inclusion involves changing an existing sub-header, remember to update locations where it's used to reflect this change. Run a search on the version of the documentation you're working on, for occurrences of this header but with hyphens delimitation instead of spaces.
